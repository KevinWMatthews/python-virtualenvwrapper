# To set up a virtual environment, first install
virtualenv
virtualenvwrapper
#Good luck. Read my notes in Install.
#Basically,
sudo pip install virtualenv
sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper
source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
# I wonder if I need to add this to my .bashrc file...
# and maybe
sudo ldconfig

# Hey look, this didn't work as I expected.
# Why mkvirtualenv first?
mkvirtualenv <project>
cd <project>
# This step doesn't work. Can I still use it? Look into the docs and see if the command changed. I bet that it did.
setprojectdir .
deactivate
workon helloworld

This stores the virtual environment in a separate location.
To list all virtual environments, use
lsvirtualenv
lsvirtualenv -b
lsvirtualenv -l

# This could be useful if you're moving a virtual environment around? Using it in several places? Would you ever do that?
# To remove a virtual environment,
rmvirtualenv ENVNAME

# Actually, this looks pretty cool, but it's a bit much for me right now.
